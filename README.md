## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of CAGD algorithms using OpenGL within a Qt C++ application. It provides a foundation for drawing geometric shapes and curves with high efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

- **Bresenham's Algorithm**: Efficient line drawing algorithm that minimizes computational overhead.
- **Symmetric DDA Algorithm**: Digital Differential Analyzer for symmetric line drawing.
- **OpenGL Rendering**: Utilizes the power of OpenGL for efficient and hardware-accelerated rendering.
- **Qt Integration**: Designed as a Qt project for cross-platform compatibility.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- C++ compiler compatible with your development environment.
- Qt framework installed on your system.
- OpenGL development libraries.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SWeMayur/CAGD-Algorithms-Implementation
